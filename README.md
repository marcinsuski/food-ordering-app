## Overview

This is a dummy food ordering app based on real vegan restaurant menu. Made in react, with logic for adding products to cart, managing them in cart and placing an order. On the back-end there is a Firebase database to store products and orders.

## Utilities
The app allows user to choose appropriate number of products and add them to cart.
The cart icon bumps on adding new items to cart and updates number of products in cart.
The cart component allows editing the products amount or even deleting items.
If the user is ready to order, they can place an order filling the form that shows upon clicking "order" button.
The form includes simpe validation and feedback to the user when problems occur.
After succesful order there is also feedback to the client and data is sent to a firebase database (obviously a dummy database, only to check functionality).
